Connect the GitHub repo to the local repo (folder) to get the to communicate

Add = makes git aware that you have a new file
Commit = log the version of the file you've been working on
This happens on the local computer

git add [file] = adds the file to the local repo
but then just git commit (w/ no file name)
OR git commit -m "[changes]"

Push = sending the local changes up to GitHub

Once a file has been added, any time there are changes made, all you need to do is save and then commit to log changes. File is already being "tracked" (no need to add it again)
